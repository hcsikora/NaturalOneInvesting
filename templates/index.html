<p>Sometimes life takes a turn for the worst: You land on "Go to Jail" in monopoly, the roulette ball goes to a black number when you bet on black, or you roll a 1 when playing Dungeons and Dragons. For the uninitiated rolling a 1 in DND with a 20-sided die is the worst-case scenario for your character. It often makes even simple tasks end in hilarious failure. Dungeons Master’s everywhere have taken advantage of the terrible roll to insert the randomness and unpredictability of our world into their games, crafting troublesome circumstances for their players.
In the world of investing, banks, financial institutions, and hedge funds always keep in mind the possibility of rolling a real world 1 when investing. This allows them to understand their risk in a more fundamental way. However, many retail investors often focus on either the average projected return of stocks or assume the worst-case scenario is loss of one’s entire investment. Neither is healthy way of looking at stock purchases.
Large stocks almost never go to zero in -short period of time. Though it has happened, investing like it happens often can lead to passive behavior in investing. On the flip-side, considering average returns only when investing fails to consider how much a person might lose over a short period of time.
